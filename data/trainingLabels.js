/*The trainingLabels represent the target values or labels associated with your training data. In the context of ocean tides, the trainingLabels would typically be an array of tide levels corresponding to each data point in your training data.

Here's an example of how the trainingLabels array could be structured for ocean tide prediction:
*/
const trainingLabels = [0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 0.7, 0.9];
/*
In this example, the trainingLabels array contains numerical values representing the tide levels associated with each data point in the training data.

The length of the trainingLabels array should match the number of data points in your training data. Each label in the trainingLabels array corresponds to a specific data point in your training data.

Ensure that the trainingLabels array is structured correctly and aligns with your training data. It should contain the target values you want your model to learn and predict based on the input data.

Note: If your labels have additional properties or metadata associated with them (e.g., timestamps, locations), you can structure the trainingLabels as an array of objects similar to the training data structure. Each object can contain properties such as timestamp and tideLevel. Adjust the preprocessing logic accordingly to extract the relevant information for training the model.
